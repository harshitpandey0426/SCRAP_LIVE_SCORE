About:
An Assingment on Web Scrapping in which we are asked to scrap live cricket score(can be extended).

Working:
1.URL of the live match will be asked when you run python file.

2.In 'other' directory some audio files are placed.

2. Then as soon as Four or Six or Wicket will fall an audio file will be played.

3. It is useful when you don't want to watch entire match , but want to get updated with an audio in background when something intresting is happening.
